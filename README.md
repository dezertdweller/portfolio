### Experience

**Data Scientist Fellow**
*Springboard* | *Remote* | Feb 2024 – Nov 2024
-	Developed end-to-end ETL pipelines to clean, validate, and prepare data for analysis, working with datasets sourced from APIs, web scraping, and structured file formats like PDF, CSV and JSON.
-	Constructed complex SQL queries to extract and transform actionable insights from relational databases, optimizing data processing workflows.
-	Built machine learning models (e.g., random forest, logistic regression) in Python to solve predictive analytics problems, improving model accuracy through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
-	Optimized a Python script for calculating historical performance metrics, reducing runtime from 4 days to 20 minutes by implementing a window function for efficient row-wise calculations.
-	Applied statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, A/B testing) to validate insight, improve feature engineering, and support decision-making in project contexts.

**Data Consultant**  
*Self-Employed, KLG Consulting* | *Seattle, WA* | Mar 2021 - Dec 2024
